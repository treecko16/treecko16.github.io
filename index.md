# James Allen

Intelligent and driven worker who is fascinated by new and emerging technologies including dapps, natural language processing, and machine vision advances. Experienced in working with C# as part of the .NET framework to make systems ranging from an ASP web application with Microsoft SQL Server backend, to simple TUIs for useful tools.

This site serves as a record of my past projects. It's currently quite empty, but should fill up as I write up old work.
